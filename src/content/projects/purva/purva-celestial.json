And the registration and possession dates are not known at all.\r\n\r\nFurnishing work in T13 is still going on and without this completion possession cannot be given. I have to admit I am quite disappointed with the service. @Purvanakara-Delivering on your promise is key to retain existing customers and attract new ones.\r\n\r\nI see lack of alignment between the construction team, the sales team and the customer service team. The sales team gets to promise you the world and then the customer service team is left to bear the anger and frustration of customers due to delay on part of the construction team and the overall management.\r\n\r\nI expected much more from Puravankara.\r\n\r\nFor my review I will probably get the same reply as others have received stating that we can contact the customer service!! Please, do not give this reply. Rather, try your best and deliver.\r",
