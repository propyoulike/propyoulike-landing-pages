Little bit far from the city but well connected to metro and nice road . Another plus point is reputed schools and colleges are near by to this project . Vedaprabhu explained the project details clearly . Bangalore needs these kind of sustainable villas for our future generation. Must visit if anyone wants to purchase a villa in south Bangalore..\r",

I don?t think anyone who visit the site and meet the individual staff there, would not want to seriously look into buying a property here. Clean legal documents and several sensible and satisfied customers who already call Urbanrise their home, makes it a compelling proposition. Their customer interaction practice both at the site and at the corporate office is highly professional. Price is a bit on the higher side but looking on the ground infrastructure you can think differently.",
