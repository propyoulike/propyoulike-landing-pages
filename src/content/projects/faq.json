    "question": "I'm buying a home for the first time — where should I even start?",
    "answer": "Start by figuring out your budget, preferred locations, and the kind of home you want. Once you shortlist a few projects, compare builder reputation, approvals, layout efficiency, and pricing. It's normal to feel overwhelmed in the beginning—just take it step by step."
  },
  {
    "category": "General",
    "question": "I'm confused about Carpet Area, Built-Up Area, and Super Built-Up Area — what’s the real difference?",
    "answer": "Carpet Area is the actual usable area inside your walls. Built-Up Area includes the carpet area plus internal walls. Super Built-Up Area additionally includes your share of common spaces like lobbies, lifts, and corridors. Always compare based on carpet area for an accurate sense of usable space."

  {
    "category": "General",
    "question": "Should I pick an under-construction home or a ready-to-move one?",
    "answer": "Ready homes offer immediate possession and no GST but usually cost more. Under-construction homes are cheaper but come with construction timelines. If you want value and flexibility, under-construction works. If you want certainty, choose ready-to-move."
  },
  {
    "category": "General",
    "question": "Should I wait for property prices to drop before buying?",
    "answer": "Real estate prices rarely drop significantly in strong markets. Instead of waiting for the 'perfect price,' focus on choosing the right property in a good location—those appreciate consistently."
  },
  {
    "category": "Area",
    "question": "How do I know if a location is good for long-term living?",
    "answer": "Consider commute times, schools, hospitals, supermarkets, upcoming infrastructure, safety, and how the area feels when you visit. If the locality is well-connected and shows signs of growth, it's usually a solid long-term choice."
  },
  {
    "category": "Area",
    "question": "What should I keep in mind while buying a flat in Bangalore?",
    "answer": "Check the location, builder reputation, RERA approval, carpet area, UDS, amenities, possession timelines, and connectivity. Also verify legal documents on the Kaveri or Karnataka RERA portals."
  },
  {
    "category": "Property",
    "question": "What should I really look for during a site visit?",
    "answer": "Check road access, building quality, neighborhood cleanliness, noise levels, natural light, ventilation, and how the sample flat compares to the actual floor plan. Site visits tell you things brochures don’t."
  },
  {
    "category": "Property",
    "question": "How do I properly compare two projects?",
    "answer": "Compare carpet area, price per sq.ft, layout efficiency, amenities, builder reputation, possession timeline, and legal approvals. A well-designed layout can feel more spacious even at the same size."
  },
  {
    "category": "Property",
    "question": "Is it okay to book a home just based on the sample flat?",
    "answer": "Use the sample flat only to understand space and design. It often has enhanced interiors and no structural elements like beams/ducts. Always rely on the actual floor plan and agreement."

    "category": "Property",
    "question": "What’s a comfortable apartment size for a small family?",
    "answer": "A 2 BHK of 900–1200 sq.ft (built-up) suits a small family well. If you work from home or expect to expand, consider a 2.5 or 3 BHK."
  },
  {
    "category": "Price",
    "question": "Why do two similar-looking projects have completely different prices?",

  },
  {
    "category": "Price",
    "question": "Is price per sq.ft the right way to compare homes?",
    "answer": "Price per sq.ft helps, but layout efficiency matters more. Some 1,000 sq.ft homes feel bigger than others due to better planning. Compare overall livability, not just the rate. Chat on WhatsApp → [whatsapp:+919379822010]"

  {
    "category": "Price",

  },
  {
    "category": "Price",

    "category": "Price",
    "question": "How do I know if I’m getting a good deal?",

  },
  {
    "category": "Negotiation",
    "question": "What’s the right way to ask a builder for a discount without feeling awkward?",

  },
  {
    "category": "Negotiation",
    "question": "If the builder says the price is fixed, what else can I negotiate?",

  },
  {
    "category": "Negotiation",
    "question": "Does comparing offers from other projects help during negotiation?",

  },
  {
    "category": "Vastu",
    "question": "How important is Vastu when choosing a home?",

  },
  {
    "category": "Vastu",
    "question": "What basic Vastu factors should I check in an apartment?",
    "answer": "Entrance direction, kitchen placement (ideally southeast), and master bedroom location (preferably southwest) are common Vastu considerations. Natural light and airflow also align with Vastu principles."
  },
  {
    "category": "Vastu",
    "question": "Can Vastu issues be corrected later without major changes?",
    "answer": "Many minor Vastu concerns can be managed through interior design—like adjusting furniture, adding mirrors, or using specific colors—without structural alterations."
  },
  {
    "category": "Home Loan",
    "question": "How do banks calculate my home loan eligibility?",
    "answer": "Banks evaluate your income, EMI capacity, age, credit score, employment stability, existing loans, and the property's valuation. A common rule of thumb is: salaried buyers get 45–60× their monthly income as loan eligibility, self-employed get 35–45×, and professionals can sometimes get 60–70×. Younger buyers qualify for longer tenures and therefore higher loan amounts. Chat on WhatsApp → [whatsapp:+919379822010]"
