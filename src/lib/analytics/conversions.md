\# Conversion Definitions



\## Primary Conversions

Primary conversions represent direct business value.



Only `lead\_created` events with the following lead types qualify:

\- sales\_enquiry

\- site\_visit\_request



These are the only metrics suitable for ROI, CAC, and revenue reporting.



\## Secondary Conversions

Secondary conversions indicate user intent or engagement but do not

represent immediate business value.



Examples include:

\- CTA clicks

\- Form submissions

\- Brochure downloads

\- Video completions



Secondary conversions are used for funnel analysis and optimization,

not success measurement.
